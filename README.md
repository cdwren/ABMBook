# Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology
Welcome to the code repository for *Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology*, by Iza Romanowska, Colin D. Wren, and Stefani A. Crabtree. In the folders above, you will find the NetLogo code referenced in each chapter, along with the following additional files where applicable: .CSV, ASCII, Excel, Python, R, images, and more. 

**Put something about the `colorblind_friendly` and `other versions` folders here.**

This book uses the modeling software NetLogo. If you do not have NetLogo already, you can get it here:
